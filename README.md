# First-Project
High school C# project

This is the first real program I made. Though I've made smaller programs before, this was a full on game that I developed in my high school computer science class. It does not use any object-oriented programming, but makes use of sprites. It is a game based off of Yoshi killing Bowser. It is very simple.

You can download the .exe under the v1.0 release. This will launch the game. You can also launch the game through the game files by finding the same executable under bin/Debug

Instructions to play the game will be prompted when you open the application. It is a VERY SHORT game, and was mainly meant to learn C# and programming in general.
